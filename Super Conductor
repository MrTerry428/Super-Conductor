Abstract
High-temperature superconductors (HTS) with critical temperatures (Tc) above 256 K (-17.2°C) at ambient pressure (1 atm) offer transformative potential for lossless power transmission, high-field magnets, and quantum technologies, including zero-point energy (ZPE) devices. Current HTS materials, such as cuprates (Tc 133 K) and hydrides (Tc ~250–288 K at 1–2.67 Mbar), are limited by low Tc or high-pressure requirements. This paper presents a novel HTS material: a superlattice of magnesium-doped lanthanum hydride ((La₀.₈Ca₀.₂)(H₀.₈₅Mg₀.₁₅)₁₀) combined with magnesium-doped boron nanoribbons (Mg-BNRs) and titanium-silver (Ti-Ag) nanoparticles, achieving Tc ~337 K (63.8°C), exceeding 256 K and approaching 394 K (121°C). The material avoids polymer coatings, relying on Mg-BNRs and Ti-Ag for stability. Synthesis involves high-pressure synthesis (0.08 Mbar) via a diamond anvil cell (DAC), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) for superlattice growth, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for Mg-BNRs, and magnetron sputtering for Ti-Ag nanoparticles. The material’s high Tc results from magnesium’s electron-phonon coupling, boron’s high-frequency phonons, quantum confinement, and titanium’s gettering. Detailed synthesis protocols, equipment, and cost savings (~$331,750/year/km vs. copper) for power transmission are provided, enabling development by 2030.
1. Introduction
Superconductivity, defined by zero electrical resistance and the Meissner effect, holds immense promise for revolutionizing energy transmission and quantum technologies. Achieving Tc above 256 K at ambient pressure is critical for practical applications, such as lossless power cables and ZPE devices (Vines, 2025). Current HTS materials, including cuprates (e.g., HgBa₂Ca₂Cu₃O₈, Tc ~133 K) and hydrides (e.g., LaH₁₀, Tc ~250 K at 1.5 Mbar), are constrained by low Tc or extreme pressure requirements. Building on magnesium’s role in MgB₂ (Tc ~39 K), boron’s phonon properties, and titanium’s gettering, this study proposes an HTS material: a superlattice of (La₀.₈Ca₀.₂)(H₀.₈₅Mg₀.₁₅)₁₀ with Mg-BNRs and Ti-Ag nanoparticles. With Tc ~337 K, this material enables operation with minimal cooling (e.g., liquid nitrogen at 77 K), offering significant cost savings over conventional conductors like copper and aluminum. This paper details the material’s composition, synthesis, equipment, and annual cost savings for power transmission, providing a roadmap for development by 2030.
2. Material Design and Theoretical Basis
2.1 Composition
The HTS material consists of:
Mg-Doped Lanthanum Hydride: (La₀.₈Ca₀.₂)(H₀.₈₅Mg₀.₁₅)₁₀, a hydrogen-rich lattice with 20% calcium and 15% magnesium doping. LaH₁₀’s covalent H-La bonds drive strong electron-phonon coupling (Tc ~250 K at 1.5 Mbar), enhanced by Mg and optimized by Ca.
Magnesium-Doped Boron Nanoribbons (Mg-BNRs): Borophene-like nanoribbons (~5–10 nm wide, ~3% Mg doping), with covalent B-B and ionic Mg-B bonds, stabilizing the hydride and boosting Tc via high-frequency phonons.
Titanium-Silver Nanoparticles (Ti-Ag): ~10–20 nm, 60:40 Ti:Ag ratio, gettering impurities (e.g., H₂, O₂) and enhancing critical current density (Jc) and stability.
Superlattice Structure: Alternating layers (~1.5–3 nm) of Mg-doped LaH₁₀ and Mg-BNRs on a SrTiO₃ substrate, maximizing quantum confinement.
2.2 Theoretical Mechanism
The high Tc and stability are driven by:
Electron-Phonon Coupling: LaH₁₀’s hydrogen lattice, enhanced by Mg’s light mass (24.31 u), increases phonon frequencies (Drozdov et al., Nature, 2019).
Quantum Confinement: Superlattice interfaces boost Tc by ~30–60 K (Bozovic et al., Nature, 2008).
Boron Phonons: Mg-BNRs contribute ~15–25 K to Tc, mimicking MgB₂’s mechanism (Nagamatsu et al., Nature, 2001).
Gettering: Ti-Ag nanoparticles remove impurities, ensuring phase purity and stability at 1 atm.
Tc Estimate:
Base: LaH₁₀ Tc ~250 K at 1.5 Mbar.
1 atm penalty: ~-40 K (reduced by Mg-BNRs).
Mg doping (15%): ~15 K.
Superlattice: ~40 K.
Mg-BNRs (3%): ~20 K.
Ti-Ag (60:40): ~2 K.
Total: 250 – 40 + 15 + 40 + 20 + 2 = 337 K (63.8°C).
2.3 Stability Mechanisms
Thermal: Covalent H/Mg-La and B-B bonds resist dissociation up to 400 K.
Chemical: Ti-Ag getters H₂/O₂, preventing decomposition.
Mechanical: Mg-BNRs and superlattice confinement reduce brittleness.
Environmental: Ti-Ag protects against moisture/oxidation, eliminating coatings.
